@zburchill (Florian said you had recently grappled with the same issue). I have a question about how to handle convergence failures when you're fitting models to simulated data sets. The workflow is to (1) use plyr::rdply to simulate data sets --> (2) dplyr::do to fit models to them and put them into a data frame --> (3) broom::tidy to extract model estimates. Some of the models at step 2 fail to converge, but this is not taken into account by broom::tidy, it just summarizes *all* models. How can I take a look at which models have failed to converge in step 2? For instance, it'd be useful to add a column to the tibble from step (2) that identifies failures to converge, so that they can be further explored and possibly filtered at step 3. Any suggestions? (see MWE)
